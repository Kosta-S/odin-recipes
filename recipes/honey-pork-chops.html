    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A quick and simple grilled pork chop that everyone will love featuring a simple and easy glaze.</p>
    <p class="long">When you're in need of a quick and easy dinner that the whole family will love, look no further than pork chops. This 5-star grilled pork chop recipe has reviewers' mouths watering thanks to the spectacular honey-garlic glaze — but the 25-minute fridge-to-table time is also a perk too. </p>

    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <div class="container">
    <ul class="list-dots">
        <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons honey</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>6 (4 ounce) (1-inch thick) pork chops</li>
      
    </ul></div>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div class="container">
    <ol class="list-dots">
        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Gather ingredients. </li>
        <li>Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a glaze. </li>
        <li>Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy! </li>
